## Notes

- If we want to support other validation strategies (like kfold or holdout). ✅


- Population proteomics → biological context for clinical thresholds?  include age/sex/BMI as covariates. ?

- In multiclass classification choose between ordinal on nominal targets ? TBD

- For preprocessing consider 15N normalization instaed of median normalization. TBD

- additional plots
sklearn.calibration_curve().
Brier score = mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and true outcomes (lower = better).
